    <h1>What is the Magic Hate Ball?</h1>
    <p id="aboutUsParagraph">The Magic Hate Ball is a project put together by a small band of Code Fellows students. We chose to make a twist on the traditional magic 8 ball to make it more interesting for users to engage. Our magic Hate Ball is a grumpy cat that is hard to please. Little do you know there is a secret to make this grumpy cat happy, and give you the answers you desire. You can learn more about this ragtag group below.</p>
